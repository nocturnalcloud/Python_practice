#what is a computer program?
# computer program = a collection of instructions executed by a computer

# each computer has an instruction list
# instruction list = the set of instructions the given computer can execute; written in the form of machine code

# we use high level to create source code

# source code ----------> machine code

# this transofrmation can be done in 2 ways!

# 1. compilation
#  - compile the source code only once
#  - anyone can run the executable

# for exqmple when you have microsoft windows it gives you an exe file and you can share with who ever

# 2.interpretation
#  - interpret source code everytime you run programs
#. - everyone needs the interpreter to run

# python is an inrepter alnguage or scripting language

# Pythong typically reads code from top to bottom
# throws errors based on checking:
#. 1. lexis --------> keywords
#. 2. syntax -------> rules for constructing python instructions
#. 3. semantics -----> additional prompts
